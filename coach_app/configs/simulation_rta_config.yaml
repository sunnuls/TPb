# Simulation RTA Configuration
# For Multi-Agent Game Theory Research in Virtual Environments
#
# Educational Use Only: This configuration is designed for continuous
# simulation loops in controlled virtual environments. It disables
# ethical constraints to enable research on strategic decision-making.
